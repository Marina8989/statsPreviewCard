# Stats preview card component

![Design preview for the Stats preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, I used a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## The project

My task was to build out the project to the designs provided. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs meant that I had to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

## Building my project

1. Initialized my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Configured my repository to publish my code to a web address.
3. Looked through the designs to start planning out how I will tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, I structured my content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Wrote out the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`. In this project I also used SaSS.
6. Added styles to the top of the page and worked down.
